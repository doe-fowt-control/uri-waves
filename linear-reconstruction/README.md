To run this code, download the data available at the shared Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AAO5OBY7s6L9Uk9PVA. Preserve the `data` folder so the scripts can find it. 

Save the folder `linear-reconstruction` at the same level as `data`. 

Run `edinburgh6.m`. Read comments to see how to change `k_n` range and the number of spatiotemporal samples controlled by `nx`, `nt`.
